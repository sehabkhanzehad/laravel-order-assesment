D1. If the system scales to over 1 million orders, what would you optimize first and why?

    - First, I would optimize the database indexing and queries.
    - Use pagination don’t load too much data at once
    - Avoid N+1 queries by using eager loading 
    - Move heavy tasks to background jobs
    - Keep API responses small by loading only necessary data
    - Use caching


D2. Which Laravel feature do developers misuse most and how do you avoid it?

In my opinion common mistakes:

- Writing too much business logic inside controllers
- N+1 queries by careless lazy loading
- Not follow separation of concerns
- Not use jobs for heavy tasks
- use directly env variables etc

Avoid these by:

- Follow MVC pattern and keep controllers thin
- Use Eager loading when needed
- Use service classes to separate business logic
- Use jobs for heavy tasks
- Use config files instead of env directly
